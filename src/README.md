# Rest API - marketplace

This is a Demo rest API using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL

# Requirements

* JAVA 8
* Maven
* Swagger for test Endpoints
* Spring Security
* MyBatis or Hibernate (ORM)


## Steps to Setup

**1. Clone the application**
```
https://github.com/devLeon93/marketplace-restAPI.git
```

## **Build and run the app using maven**
```
mvn package
java -jar target/marketplace-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Ð’atabase configuration

Enter following at the command line:

**psql -U postgres**

Enter your password from DB Server PostgreSQL:

**Password for user postgres:** ******************

**postgres=#  create database marketplace_db;**

**CREATE DATABASE**

Create user and password for db:

**postgres=# create user xxxxx  with encrypted password '*******';**

**CREATE ROLE**

Grant privileges:

**postgres=# grant all privileges on database marketplace_db to testuser;**

**GRANT**

```
application.properties

spring.datasource.driverClassName = org.postgresql.Driver
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/marketplace_db
spring.datasource.username= testuser
spring.datasource.password= pass93

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect= org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto= update


server.port=8085

```

After that you will need to connect the database in the IDE IntellijIdea itself or separately in another editor, for example: Data Grip
In the **resources directory** you are find sql file  **script.sql** for help run script


##   Explore Rest APIs

**These are all Endpoints that I have been able to implement the rest of the endpoints were made, but the refactoring had to remove them they are under development :**

## product Endpoints

**The app will start running at [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085/).**

**GET :    localhost:8085/product/getAll**

**GET :    localhost:8085/product/get/{id}**

**POST : localhost:8085/product/add**

**DELETE : localhost:8085/product/delete/{id}**

**All Endpoints can be tested using Docs API - Swagger**

** To test how it works you can follow this link, but before you will need to authenticate
But before that, you need to write to the user table
http://localhost:8085/swagger-ui/index.html 
**
For example :
```
login - leo93
password - pass93
```

**This login and password are taken from the users table, which contains the users**
